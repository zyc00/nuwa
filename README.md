# nuwa

nuwa (Â•≥Â™ßÔºèÂ•≥Â®≤, N«öwƒÅ) is a Python library for pre-processing images and videos for 3D reconstruction and generation pipelines. It provides a simple interface to load images or videos, estimate camera parameters, calculate object masks, and save the results in a structured format (NuwaDB).


## Get started

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
# make sure you have colmap in your PATH, otherwise run:
# sudo apt install -y colmap 
# or follow official installation guide for CUDA support (see FAQ below)
pip install git+https://github.com/jetd1/nuwa.git

# (optional) if you want to use segmentation for object oriented scenes (--object)
./additional_dependencies/setup_seg.sh

# (optional) if you want to use `nuwat gs2mesh` to generate mesh
./additional_dependencies/setup_mesh.sh

# (optional) if you want to fine-tune pose with instant-ngp
./additional_dependencies/setup_ingp.sh
```

üßë‚Äçüíª CLI

```bash
# To process a video:
nuwa -v VIDEO_PATH -o OUT_DIR --fps 30

# To process a folder of images:
nuwa -i IMAGE_DIR -o OUT_DIR  # --object (optional)

# To process a polycam zip / folder:
nuwa -p polycam.zip -o OUT_DIR  # --portrait --object --finetune-pose (optional)

# To process a 3dscannerapp zip / folder:
nuwa -s scan.zip -o OUT_DIR  # --object --finetune-pose (optional)

# To process a DEAR zip / folder:
nuwa -d dear.zip -o OUT_DIR  # --portrait --object --finetune-pose (optional)

# To view all options:
nuwa -h

# To generate sparse point sets for a nuwadb:
nuwa-tools genpoints -i NUWADB_DIR  # -o OUT_DIR (optional)

# (nuwat is an alias for nuwa-tools)
# To generate mesh from point clouds (or gaussian splats .ply):
nuwat gs2mesh -i A.ply -o B.ply

# (nuwat is an alias for nuwa-tools)
# To downsample the images in a db:
nuwat downsample -i NUWADB_DIR -o OUT_DIR -r 2  # (for half) or `-r 1000` (for max 1000px)

# (nuwat is an alias for nuwa-tools)
# To segment a image folder:
nuwat seg -i IMG_DIR -o OUT_DIR
```

üêç Python

```python
import nuwa

db = nuwa.from_image_folder(img_dir)
# db = nuwa.from_video(video_dir, out_img_dir)
# db = nuwa.from_colmap(img_dir, colmap_dir)
# db = nuwa.from_polycam(polycam_dir)
# db = nuwa.from_3dscannerapp(3dscannerapp_dir)
# db = nuwa.from_dear(dear_dir)

db.dump("db.json")
```

## FAQ

### colmap and other sfm pipelines
1. `colmap` could be installed with `apt install -y colmap`. This version is CPU-only. To install the GPU version, please refer to `setup_pixsfm.sh:21` or the [official colmap installation guide](https://colmap.github.io/install.html).
2. nuwa uses colmap from system path by default. If you have a different version of colmap, you can specify the path to the colmap executable using the `--colmap-binary` argument.
3. To use a more advanced sfm pipeline (hloc, hloc++), you need to first install the required dependencies as shown in `additional_dependencies/setup_pixsfm.sh`.
4. If you need the original colmap database/sparse estimation (e.g. for 3DGS pipelines), please pass `--colmap-dir` or `colmap_out_dir` explicitly. 

### App-sourced data
1. `--portrait` flag is mandatory for portrait-oriented scenes captured in polycam or DEAR.
2. If you have a rough estimate of the camera poses, you can pass `--finetune-pose` to refine the poses with instant-ngp. This requires you to have an instant-ngp built locally. Please follow the instructions in `additional_dependencies/setup_ingp.sh`.

### Known issues 
1. If you encountered any issue with `flann`, try running with `--no-loop-detection` or pass `colmap_loop_detection=False`. There is likely an issue with your system kernel.

### Segmentation
1. The segmentation pipeline follows the *largest* object as the foreground. Make sure the object you want to segment is visible in the first frame and is the largest throughout the images.
2. Pass `--object` to indicate the scene needs normalization and segmentation.

## TODO
- [ ] refloor / wireframe for better mesh
- [ ] Adapt neuralangelo extended json format
- [ ] Reorganize transformations in reconstruction
- [ ] Improve fg masking
- [ ] Clearer way to ref org, org_masked (mask), cropped_masked (mask).
- [ ] More camera normalization options
- [ ] Org path is not well tracked in finetune_pose*
